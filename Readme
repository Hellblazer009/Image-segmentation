## Summary: 
# code for segmenting boundaries of iris and pupil in human eyes for downstream application of eye based motion control. 
# U-Net implementation with 4 layers down and up, one FC in the middle.
# training data comprises eye image and annotated mask with boundary separations


## Installation:
# Jupyter notebook format installation. All modalities in the header of the code. Use !pip install or npm install for individual modules where necessary.

## Basic use:

### Preprocessing: specify training and test image dimensions for designing U-Net arch
# specify file location or directory to import datasets
# resize images to specification
# designate masks as labels/output for training
# repeat for test set


### U-Net model: vectorize input tensor according to image dimensions and number of channels.
# layer design is manual, downsampling and upsampling layers dependent on image dimensions
# can add more FC layers if necessary
# kernel initialization and activation functions as specified in code example
# drop out as specified in code example
# check model summary for arch and verification
